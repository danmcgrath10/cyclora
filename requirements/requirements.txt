== Project Overview

Cyclora is a highly optimized, energy-efficient road cycling tracker app for iOS, built in React Native with comprehensive battery management. Designed to provide cyclists with reliable, long-duration ride tracking with industry-leading power efficiency and modern athletic UI design.

The app features a complete optimization system that extends battery life by 2-3x compared to typical GPS tracking apps, making it ideal for long-distance cycling and multi-day tours. The design follows modern athletic app principles inspired by Strava and Runna, with an orange primary theme (#FF6B35) and stats-first layouts.

Core Features:
* Advanced GPS tracking with 3 power modes (Performance, Balanced, Battery Saver)
* Intelligent screen management with auto-dimming and wake-on-tap
* Smart background processing with task deferral system
* Network optimization with WiFi-only uploads and data compression
* Athletic design with real-time optimization feedback
* Comprehensive battery life estimates (4-12+ hours depending on mode)

The app prioritizes:
- Maximum energy efficiency (comprehensive power management system)
- Data privacy (all health data processed on-device or anonymized)
- Offline functionality (full ride tracking and storage without internet)
- Professional athletic aesthetics with orange brand identity
- Long-distance cycling support (optimized for rides >4 hours)
